Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization 
Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization using Python 🚀

Overview
Effective demand forecasting and inventory optimization are crucial for businesses to ensure seamless supply chain operations. Demand Forecasting involves predicting future customer demand for a product or service using historical data and external factors. Inventory Optimization ensures the right stock levels are maintained—meeting customer demand while minimizing costs.

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization using Python. It covers data collection, forecasting methods, and inventory strategies to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

📌 Process Overview

1️⃣ Demand Forecasting
What is Demand Forecasting?
Demand Forecasting is the process of predicting future customer orders based on historical sales data, market trends, seasonality, and other external factors. Accurate forecasting helps businesses:

✅ Improve resource allocation
✅ Avoid stock shortages and overstocking
✅ Enhance supply chain efficiency

Techniques Used:

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
Exponential Smoothing

2️⃣ Inventory Optimization
What is Inventory Optimization?
Inventory Optimization ensures businesses maintain an optimal balance between supply and demand by reducing costs and improving efficiency. It helps:

✅ Reduce carrying costs

✅ Improve cash flow

✅ Minimize stockouts and overstock situations

Key Strategies Implemented:

Reorder Points 📌 – Determines when to place new orders

Safety Stock 🛡 – Maintains buffer inventory for uncertainties

Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) 📦 – Identifies the optimal order size

📊 Step-by-Step Implementation

1️⃣ Data Collection
We start by collecting historical sales data, customer orders, and external factors like seasonality and promotions. The dataset used in this project contains:
Date (Time period of sales)

Demand (Units sold per day)

Inventory (Stock levels over time)

💾 Dataset: You can download the dataset here.

2️⃣ Demand Forecasting Implementation
Using SARIMA, we predict demand for the next 10 days.

📌 Forecasted Demand Example:
Date	Forecasted Demand
2023-08-02	117
2023-08-03	116
2023-08-04	130
2023-08-05	114
2023-08-06	128
📌 These predictions help businesses plan inventory restocking efficiently.

3️⃣ Inventory Optimization Metrics
Once we forecast demand, we apply inventory management strategies:

✅ Key Metrics Calculated
Metric	Value
Optimal Order Quantity (EOQ)	236
Reorder Point	235.25
Safety Stock	114.45
Total Inventory Cost	$561.80

📌 Breakdown:

EOQ (236 units): The ideal quantity to order when restocking.
Reorder Point (235.25 units): When inventory reaches this level, a new order is triggered.
Safety Stock (114.45 units): Extra buffer stock to handle uncertainties.
Total Cost ($561.80): Estimated cost of managing inventory efficiently.

📌 Summary
This project demonstrates how Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization can help businesses make data-driven inventory decisions. By accurately predicting demand and optimizing stock levels, companies can reduce costs, avoid stockouts, and enhance customer satisfaction.

🚀 Key Takeaways:

✅ Demand Forecasting: Improves inventory planning and reduces uncertainty.

✅ Inventory Optimization: Ensures stock availability while minimizing costs.

✅ EOQ & Safety Stock: Helps maintain the right balance between ordering and holding stock.
